# Divijuorut Wordpress Theme

Divijuorut is a pseudo-news rumour site based on series of inside jokes originating from my class at Metropolia. The site started as an assignment for front-end development course but was later to convert to personal Wordpress theme development practice. In development demo version of the site lives at divijuarut.demo.site.
